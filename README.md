# PlaylistScraper

A script for scraping video titles and links from a given Youtube playlist page. It uses Selenium to dynamically load the page and retrieve every element. The script outputs a CSV file containing two columns: title, and link.
Because it has to load every element, it's a little slow :(

# TODO
Fill output with other elements, like view count and age.
